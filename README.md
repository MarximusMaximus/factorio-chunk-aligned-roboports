# factorio-chunk-aligned-roboports

by Marximus Maximus (<https://marximus.com>)

Resizes the roboports to fit exactly one and half chunks, the big power pole to span one chunk, and the substations to cover one quarter of a chunk. Additionally supports some modded roboports, power poles, and substations.

Forked from chunk-sized-roboports 3.2.1 by Graveeater.

# Features

* Roboports' construction radius is now 64 tiles (one whole chunk) and can place the next chunk's roboport.
* Roboports' logistic radius is now 32 tiles (half of a chunk) such that each chunk having a roboport will create a full coverage logistic network.
* Big power poles wire reach is now 32 tiles (half of a chunk), power radius stays the same at 2 tile radius.
* Substation reach wire reach is now 16 tiles (quarter of a chunk), power radius is now 8 tiles (eighth of a chunk).
* Krastorio2's roboports/poles are also supported.
* DyWorld's roboports/poles are also supported.
* Bob's roboports/poles are also supported.
